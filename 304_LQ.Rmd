#Abstract
The objective of this report is to predict which party will win the election if all ages citizens in Canada had voted for the 2019 Canadian Federal Election. Models will be built based on the online survey results of Canadian Election Study in 2019. Next, apply the model to the 2016 census data to find which party will have the highest votes. Finally, comparing the predicted result with the actual election result of 2019 to find if there will exist any difference.

## Introduction 
The survey result of 2019 Canadian Election Study has more than 37000 survey answers on over 600 questions. In our project, the target population is all Canadian citizens; the sample population consists of 37822 respondents. 

In the model, "age","province", "education" and "gender" will be considered as independent variables and "vote choice" will be the only response variable. Additionally, eight vote choices are included in the outcome variable and their distributions are shown in Figure 1. It reveals that the majority chose "Liberal Party"; "Conservative Party" was the second popular choice; "People's Party" had the lowest vote. Next, using the mentioned variables to built a logistic regression, and then implement this model to the 2016 census data to predict if all ages citizens had voted then what would happen to the election result.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
choice <- data.frame(table(ces2019_web$cps19_votechoice))
choice$Var1 <- as.character(choice$Var1)
choice$Var1 <- ifelse(choice$Var1 == 'Bloc Québécois', 'Bloc Qu',
                      choice$Var1)
choice <- choice[order(-choice$Freq),]
choice

barplot(choice$Freq,
        names.arg=c("Liberal",
                    "Conservative",
                    "Noanswer",
                    "ndp",
                    "Green",
                    "BlocQu",
                    "Peoples",
                    "Another"), main="Figure 1", horiz = F)
```

## Data

The survey data is obtained from Canadian Election Study, and the census data is obtained from Statistics Canada. The summary of survey data is shown below. Next, to consist with the census data, variable "age" will be divided into five groups, "education" will be divided into six groups, "gender" will contain three groups, and "province" will keep the same. For the outcome variable, "Liberal Party", "Green Party", "Conservative Party", "ndp" and "Bloc Qu" will keep the same; other choices will be combined together, and they will be called as "Others". In addition, the data contain lots of non-response, and the reason why people refused to vote for a party was that they did not care about the election result, or they did not trust any of the parties.

## Model

The survey data consists of a lot of multi-choice questions, and we would like to transfer them to multi-binary model by using one v.s rest method[1]. To explain, if we have $n$ levels in outcome, then $n$ outcome will be obtained. For each vote choice, it would be a binary question. In this project, the first vote choice would be choosing "Liberal Party" or not, and other vote choice works in the same way.

For binary questions, logistic regression model[5] will be trained by using the equation below. In addition, categorical variables with $n$ levels will contain $n-1$ dummy variables. Next, each choice will train one logistic regression model, and then implement the model to census data to obtain the predicted probability of choosing the corresponding party.

$$ log(\frac{p}{1-p})= \beta_0+\beta_1 age + \beta_2gender + \beta_3education + \beta_4province$$

After that, one combined features group will have six predicted probability on different party. Then, we use softmax method[8] to convert the probability into a range of [0~1]. The formula of softmax method is shown below.

$$p'_i = \frac{p_i}{\sum(p_i)}$$

We use the ROC curve[3] to see how well the model is. Specifically, the ROC curve is "a graphical plot that illustrates the diagnostic ability of a binary classifier system as its discrimination threshold is varied. The ROC curve is created by plotting the true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive." The area under ROC curve is called AUC. The larger the AUC is, the better the model will be. For our six binary models, the six corresponding ROC curves are shown below. We can see that the areas are large there, in other words, the AUC is large. Therefore, we can conclude that our model is built properly.

```{r}
library(pROC)
pred.dt <- matrix(rep(0, nrow(cens.final2) * 6), ncol = 6)
vlist <- c("vote1", "vote2", "vote3", "vote4", "vote5", "vote6")
par(mfrow= c(2,3))
choice <- data.frame(table(ces2019_web$cps19_votechoice))
table(modeldat$vote5)
for (i in 1:length(vlist)) {
  v <- vlist[i]
  formula <- paste0("as.factor(",v,") ~  age_gp + gender + education + province")
  glm.m1 <- glm(as.formula(formula),
                 data = modeldat,
                 family = binomial)
  glm.m1.pred <- predict(glm.m1, newdata = cens.final2, type = "response")
  pred.dt[,i] <- glm.m1.pred
  eval(parse(text = paste0("roc1<-roc(modeldat$",v,", glm.m1$fitted.values)")))
  plot(roc1,col = "blue", main = paste0("ROC Cureve of ", v))
}
par(mfrow= c(1,1))
```
\newpage

## Results

One of the model results is shown below. It reflects that all features are significant when significance level is set as 0.1, but if we set the significance level to 0.05, then variable "education" would not be significant any more. Moreover, for the coefficient of each variable, let's take "gender" as the example, there are three levels in variable "gender"(_Male,Female,Others_). Specifically, female level is treated as the reference; the other two will compare with it. In addition, the coefficient of "genderMale" is -0.34731, it means that the odds ratio is $exp(-0.34731) = 0.7066$.

```{r}
summary(glm.m1)
```

```{r}
party.list <- c("Liberal Party", "Green Party","Conservative Party","ndp","Bloc Qu", "Others")
totalp <- apply(pred.dt, 1, sum)
pred.dt <- as.data.frame(pred.dt/totalp)
p <- round(apply(pred.dt,2, mean),3)
names(p) <- party.list
cat("The predicted probability are:\n")
p <- as.data.frame(p)
p$party <- c("Liberal", "Green","Conservative","ndp","Bloc Qu", "Others")
p <- p[order(-p$p),]
barplot(p$p,names.arg=p$party, horiz = F, main = "Estimated Probability of Each arty")
```
As we can see from the above plot, "Liberal Party" has the biggest predicted probability, which is approximately 0.26. "Conservative Party" is the second highest. Thus, we suggest that __Liberal Party__ would win the election if all ages citizens in Canada had voted for the 2019 Canadian Federal Election. Our predicted result is exactly same as the actual election result of 2019[6].

```{r}
cens.final.pred <- cbind(cens.final2, pred.dt)
finalvote <- c(sum(cens.final.pred$TotalCnt* cens.final.pred$V1),
               sum(cens.final.pred$TotalCnt* cens.final.pred$V2),
               sum(cens.final.pred$TotalCnt* cens.final.pred$V3),
               sum(cens.final.pred$TotalCnt* cens.final.pred$V4),
               sum(cens.final.pred$TotalCnt* cens.final.pred$V5),
               sum(cens.final.pred$TotalCnt* cens.final.pred$V6))/sum(cens.final.pred$TotalCnt)
cat(party.list[which.max(finalvote)], "will WIN.....")  
```

## Discussion

In this analysis, the online survey results of Canadian Election Study in 2019 is used as sample to build our prediction models. The survey contains multi-choice questions, and we have transferred them to binary questions, and we use softmax method to generate the predicted probability. According to our predicted result, we can conclude that the election result would not change if all ages citizens were considered. In other words, the winner will always be __Liberal Party__. However, the gap between   __Liberal Party__ and __Conservative Party__ is not as big as the actual election result has showed. There is a change that the __Conservative Party__ would predicted to win if we change the predictor variables or census data. 

In addition, here are some future improvements for making such prediction. Firstly, we can design and implement a better vote survey with more questions and try to get as many respondents to take the survey. Secondly, applying some other models such as decision tree to predict a more accurate result. Finally, we can add more predictor variables since other factors would influence the vote intention.
